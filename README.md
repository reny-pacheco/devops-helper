# DevOps Helper

DevOps Helper is a repository that contains helper scripts for various DevOps tasks. It provides convenience scripts for installing popular DevOps tools like Terraform and Ansible.

## Scripts

- `terraform_setup.sh`: A script to install Terraform, a tool for infrastructure provisioning and management.
- `ansible_setup.sh`: A script to install Ansible, a powerful automation and orchestration tool.

Before running the scripts, ensure they have execution permission. You can grant execution permission by running the following command:

```shell
chmod +x terraform_setup.sh ansible_setup.sh
```

After granting execution permission, you can run the scripts using the following commands:

```shell
./terraform_setup.sh
./ansible_setup.sh
```

Use these scripts to easily set up Terraform and Ansible on your system, enabling you to streamline your DevOps workflows and infrastructure management.
